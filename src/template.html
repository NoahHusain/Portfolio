              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                I am a full stack software engineer with an interest in back end web development. I attended Nashville Software School from April 2021 to September 2021 where I received my certification in the Full Stack Software Developer Program.
              </p>

              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                Ever since I was young I loved to tinker with computers. Before I was able to work officially I was paid by my cousin to build computers for his dental office. I was fascinated with how they worked and eventually built my own gaming computer and with it looked into software development. Being young at the time my mind was more occupied with playing games rather than learning to code however it did open my eyes to what the world of Software Engineering looks like.
              </p>

              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                Prior to NSS I was working as a Front Office Lead at one of the largest Pediatric Dental Firms in California. At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, I lost my job and quickly had to scramble to find a new one. I thought back to the time in college where In my sophomore year I lived with three random software engineers (who went on to become my good friends) and I knew that they were working high-paying jobs and enjoying their careers. By the next time I was talking to them I asked them what it would look like if I wanted to join their field. They told me that I should have them teach me the basics to see if I was interested and go from there. We started with Python and I became, for lack of a better term, addicted to coding. On my first application I coded for 16 straight hours only getting up for water. There was nothing quite like seeing an application I built working. From there I knew this was something I wanted to do. I continued to learn from their guidance and teaching myself until I felt that I needed a more structured approach to learning. After looking at Bootcamps with my friends I settled on NSS and gained immense amounts of not only technical knowledge and skills, but also a great amount of practical knowledge as well. I cannot wait to get into the field and join my friends in being a Software Engineer.

                    teams, users, and scores to make your games as
                    streamlined as possible. I handled the scoring component of
                    the application including monitoring scores in between
                    rounds, displaying current score, and tallying of final scores.

                    Mines-R-Us is a companion app made for miners in the

                    miners in the game, it shows all relevant info miners need to
                    be as profitable as possible such as ore patch locations, ore
                    prices, equipment costs, and a beginners guide for those
                    getting into the game. All aspects of the application were
                    built by me. This includes the JSON database, React
                    modules, and CSS styling.
